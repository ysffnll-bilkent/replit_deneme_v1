# Next.js & Tailwind CSS Spiritual Platform Demo

This answer outlines a **production-quality Next.js application** (with Tailwind CSS) that implements a multi-page **spiritual product experience platform**. We will describe each page (Home, Encyclopedia, Test, Customizer, Blog, Etsy redirect, Profile) and how it reflects the design documentation. The demo uses **no backend** – all data is mocked via JSON or in-component objects. We focus on proper project structure, adherence to the design system (pastel bohemian theme, typography, icons), responsive behavior, and accessibility (WCAG compliance). All content is in English, and the app is organized for easy future expansion (real data integration, i18n, etc.).

## Tech Stack & Architecture

* **Next.js (React)** – We use Next.js’ Pages Router for a traditional multi-page architecture. Each page is a React component in the `pages/` directory, automatically routed based on file name (e.g. `pages/about.js` serves `/about`). This gives individual URLs per section (better for SEO and shareability) while still allowing client-side transitions via `<Link>` for a smooth UX.

* **Tailwind CSS** – for styling with utility classes and customizing the theme. Tailwind’s config is extended to include our boho pastel color palette and font choices. Utility classes enable rapid responsive design (e.g. `md:grid-cols-3` for a 3-column grid on medium screens) and consistent spacing. We include Tailwind’s base, components, and utilities in a global CSS (or use the PostCSS setup) so we can style everything easily.

* **Framer Motion** – for animations and micro-interactions. We leverage `<motion>` components and variants to add smooth transitions (e.g. fading in hero text, sliding between wizard steps, button hover effects) to make the UI feel polished and “alive”.

* **Icons & Images** – We use an outlined icon library (e.g. **Heroicons** by Tailwind Labs) for minimalist, line-based icons that match the aesthetic. Heroicons’ **outline style** (1.5px stroke) gives a modern, lightweight look. High-quality placeholder images (for crystals, products, blog covers, etc.) are included in the repo (under `/public/images/…`) and loaded via Next’s built-in Image component for optimal loading. All external links (e.g. to Etsy) open in a new tab by default for good UX (users aren’t lost when visiting external sites).

* **State & Data** – Since there’s no backend, we use **mock JSON data** and React state:

  * Static JSON files in a `/data` folder (or inline objects) provide lists of products, crystals, test questions, blog posts, etc. Next.js can import this data at build time. We use **getStaticProps** for pages like the Encyclopedia and Blog to generate pages from this data. (Next.js will prerender pages based on the JSON content – similar to using a CMS, but local.) Dynamic routes use **getStaticPaths** to generate detail pages for each item (e.g. each crystal). This ensures the site is a fully static build, with no runtime calls needed, but structured such that we could swap the data source with an API or database later without major refactor.
  * Client-side state (`useState`, `useReducer`, or Context) is used for interactive flows: e.g. managing quiz answers in the Test wizard, or the selected options in the Product Customizer. We also use Context or local storage for things like saving favorites or test results so the Profile page can access them. No sensitive data is stored – just IDs or names of selected crystals, etc., for demo purposes.

* **Project Structure** – We organize the code for clarity and scalability:

  * `pages/` – Contains page components for each route:

    * `pages/index.js` – Home page.
    * `pages/encyclopedia/index.js` – Encyclopedia overview (listing items).
    * `pages/encyclopedia/[slug].js` – Encyclopedia detail (dynamic route for each product/crystal).
    * `pages/tests/index.js` – Test selection page.
    * `pages/tests/[slug].js` – Test flow page (dynamic route for each quiz, handling questions UI).
    * `pages/tests/[slug]/result.js` – Test result page (dynamic route showing outcome for a given quiz).
    * `pages/customizer.js` – Product Customizer (Jewelry Designer) page.
    * `pages/blog/index.js` – Blog overview.
    * `pages/blog/[slug].js` – Blog detail page.
    * `pages/etsy-redirect.js` – Etsy redirect info page.
    * `pages/profile.js` – User Profile page (optional).
    * (We also include `pages/_app.js` for global styles/provider and `pages/_document.js` if needed for custom font links or meta tags.)
  * `components/` – Reusable UI components:

    * **Layout components**: `Header` (site navigation bar with links to main sections), `Footer` (copyright and maybe social links), possibly a `MainLayout` that wraps pages to apply Header/Footer consistently.
    * **UI elements**: `Button`, `Card`, `Modal`, `Banner`, etc., implemented as per design system (Tailwind classes for styling, with variants for state).
    * **Domain-specific components**: e.g. `CrystalCard` (card for a crystal with image & name), `QuizQuestion` (for rendering a test question and options), `CustomizerPreview` (displaying the jewelry preview image and current selections), etc.
  * `data/` – JSON files or JS modules exporting mock data:

    * `data/crystals.json` – List of crystals/products with fields like `{ id, slug, name, image, shortDescription, longDescription, properties… }`.
    * `data/quizzes.json` – Definitions of quizzes and their questions (each quiz has an id/slug, title, questions array where each question has text and possible answers, etc., plus maybe mapping of outcomes to a product).
    * `data/posts.json` – List of blog articles (with slug, title, date, author, excerpt, content paragraphs or HTML, etc.).
    * etc.
  * `public/` – Static assets (images, icons if not using an icon font, etc.). For example, we might have images for each crystal (e.g. `public/images/crystals/amethyst.jpg`) and blog post cover images.

This layout keeps concerns separated and will make it easier to replace the mock data with real APIs later or add internationalization. (Notably, Next.js has built-in support for multiple locales and can generate localized routes/content when needed.)

## Design System & Theming

The application follows the **spiritual/bohemian design guidelines** from the documentation:

* **Color Palette:** We apply a **soft pastel, bohemian-inspired color scheme** across the site. This means lots of muted, earthy tones and gentle pastel accents for backgrounds, with higher-contrast shades for text to ensure readability. For example, the palette may include **light lavender, blush pink, sage green, sandy beige, soft grey, and warm terracotta**. These colors create a calming, serene vibe in line with spiritual and boho aesthetics – “boho decor thrives on soft pastels” that blend for a *calming effect*, while touches of *blush pink and mint* can bring a playful energy. We also incorporate *earthy neutrals* (creams, browns) to ground the design, as an **earthy boho palette** mixes natural tones like browns/greens/beiges with muted terracotta, mustard, and pinks. In practice, our Tailwind configuration defines a custom color set (e.g. `theme.colors.brandPink = #F5E1E1`, `brandMint = #D8F3DC`, `brandLavender = #EAE6F1`, `brandCream = #FBF7F4`, etc., along with deep accent colors like a charcoal or plum for text headings). We ensure sufficient contrast for text (e.g. using the darker variants for body text on light backgrounds, or vice versa) to meet accessibility standards (contrast checked per WCAG guidelines).

&#x20;*Example of a soft, earthy bohemian color theme – mixing a dusty pink-beige and a muted sage grey. This kind of pastel palette evokes a calm, natural feel, “remniscent of the desert and bohemian lifestyle,” balancing feminine light pink tones with grey/brown earthy elements for a sense of serenity.*

* **Typography:** The design calls for a **serif + sans-serif font pairing** to establish clear hierarchy and aesthetic appeal. We choose an elegant, readable serif font for headings and highlights, paired with a clean sans-serif for body text and UI labels. This contrast gives a sophisticated yet approachable feel – a common strategy is to *pair a serif with a sans serif font* to achieve harmonious typography. For example, headings might use a font like **Playfair Display** or **Cormorant Garamond** (to impart a touch of classic, spiritual elegance), while body text uses a sans-serif like **Inter** or **Open Sans** for readability. This aligns with accessibility advice: **serif fonts are effective for longer text blocks**, whereas **sans-serifs work well for UI and small screens**. We limit to 2 typefaces (3 max) to keep design consistent and avoid clutter. All text is sized and spaced for comfortable reading with a clear visual hierarchy (big, distinctive headings; medium subheadings; body text at an easily legible size with generous line-height). We also respect semantic hierarchy by using proper HTML tags (`<h1>` for the main page title, `<h2>` for section titles, etc.) so that even if styling is fancy, screen readers and browsers understand the structure.

* **Icons and Graphics:** Icons are **outline style, minimalistic** to match the clean look. As mentioned, we use Heroicons (v2 outline set) or similar, which have a thin stroke and a contemporary, “fashionable” look. These are used for small UI elements like menu toggles, social media, arrows, etc., always paired with accessible labels or `title` attributes for clarity. For instance, a heart outline icon denotes a “favorite” action, a user icon for profile, etc., all in line weight so they feel cohesive. We keep graphics meaningful and **avoid overly ornamental images** that don’t add value. High-quality photos of crystals, meditation scenes, or jewelry are used to add visual interest – these are **optimized** via Next.js image component for responsiveness. Each image has appropriate **alt text** describing it (e.g. `alt="Amethyst crystal cluster"`) so that non-visual users get the context. Any purely decorative images (if any) would be given empty alt or proper ARIA roles to be ignored by assistive tech.

* **Layout and Components:** The design system includes **cards, modals, banners, buttons** with a certain style:

  * **Cards**: We use card components for things like product entries in a grid, blog post previews, etc. These have a light background (maybe an off-white or translucent pastel overlay), subtle border or shadow, and rounded corners (to align with the soft theme). We implement cards with Tailwind classes (`bg-white/70` with opacity, `shadow-md` for a gentle shadow, `rounded-xl`, etc.). On hover or focus, cards might lift or glow slightly (using Framer Motion to scale up 1.02x or apply a shadow) – a micro-interaction to indicate interactivity.
  * **Buttons**: Buttons follow a **minimal, outlined style** as per the boho theme – for example, a primary button could have a thin border in a pastel color and transparent background by default, with a hover that fills it with that pastel. This gives a light, airy feel. We also have secondary buttons or text links styled accordingly. All buttons have sufficient padding and border-radius (Tailwind `px-4 py-2 rounded-full` for example) to be easily tappable and visually prominent. We ensure focus states are visible (outline or underline) for accessibility.
  * **Modal Panels**: There are a few use cases for modals – e.g. maybe showing a larger image, or a “newsletter signup” prompt, or as part of the customizer wizard (if steps might be implemented as modal dialogs on mobile). We implement modals using React state and portals (or consider using **Headless UI**’s `<Dialog>` for accessibility). They slide or fade into view (with Framer Motion’s AnimatePresence for a smooth fade-in/out), and have an overlay backdrop. Modals follow the design colors (perhaps a white or light beige panel with subtle drop-shadow, matching typography). We ensure to trap focus inside modals and include a close button (an outlined “X” icon) for usability.
  * **Notification Banners**: For small status messages (e.g. “Added to favorites” confirmation, or error messages), we use a banner component that spans either top or bottom of the viewport. Design-wise, banners could be in a slightly stronger color (e.g. a pale gold or soft green for success) but still within the palette. They appear using a slide-down animation and auto-dismiss after a few seconds (for non-critical notices) or remain until closed.
  * **Interactive Previews**: Especially on the Customizer page, we have a preview area showing the product being customized. This area might include an image of the jewelry piece that updates as choices are made. We ensure this container has a consistent border or frame in the UI, and possibly uses a neutral background to highlight the product (maybe a light gray or subtle gradient). Changes in the preview (like switching a stone) could be animated (e.g. crossfade images) to make the experience smooth.

* **Micro-Interactions & Animations:** We pay attention to subtle animations that enhance UX:

  * Hover states: Links and buttons have gentle transitions – e.g. an underline that slides in, or an icon that slightly shifts. We use CSS and Framer Motion for these small touches.
  * Page transitions: Next.js doesn’t do automatic page transitions, but we can manually use Framer Motion’s `<AnimatePresence>` to fade out pages on route change, or simply rely on the native instant switch (perhaps adding a top progress bar for page loading if needed).
  * Form interactions: In the Quiz and Customizer, as the user proceeds, we animate the transition to the next question/step (like slide left for Next, slide right for Back) to mimic a wizard feel. These micro-interactions provide feedback and make the app feel more polished and “alive,” which helps engage users.
  * Motion guidelines: We keep animations **fast and subtle** to avoid disrupting the calm aesthetic. E.g. 150–300ms ease transitions, no jarring large movements. The goal is to **enhance feedback** (make the UI feel responsive and human) without distracting from content. For instance, a button may slightly change color or scale on click to confirm it’s been pressed (a classic micro-interaction).

* **Responsive & Accessible Design:** From the start, we build the UI to be **mobile-friendly and accessible**. The layout uses flexbox/grid with Tailwind’s responsive breakpoints to rearrange content on smaller screens (e.g. the home page hero image might stack above text on mobile, cards collapse to single column on narrow viewports, navigation becomes a hamburger menu, etc.). We follow best practices so that **content reflows without loss of information on small screens** – no horizontal scrolling needed, no text cut off. All interactive elements have keyboard accessibility (using proper HTML elements `<button>`, `<a>` and not just divs, and adding `tabIndex` or key handlers where appropriate). We ensure sufficient color contrast for text on background (checked against WCAG AA guidelines). We use **alt text on all images/icons** to provide text alternatives for screen readers, and use ARIA roles or attributes for dynamic content as needed (for example, marking the quiz question number as `aria-live="polite"` region so updates are announced, labeling form fields clearly, etc.). We also use semantic HTML5 elements (like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`) to structure pages, which aids accessibility and SEO. Overall, we *“design with all users in mind”* and avoid relying solely on color or visuals to convey meaning (for instance, if using color-coded badges, we also include text or icons). The site’s responsiveness and accessibility go hand-in-hand: **responsive design is essential for accessibility**, ensuring a consistent experience for users on any device or screen size. We test pages with screen reader simulations and mobile devices to verify that the content is perceivable and operable for all.

With the design system established, let’s walk through each major page/section and how it’s implemented.

## Home Page

The Home page (`pages/index.js`) is the gateway to the platform. It gives a **warm welcome** with key highlights of the product offerings and content. According to the design spec, it includes:

* **Hero Section:** A prominent hero banner featuring an inspiring image and tagline. For example, a full-width image of a selection of crystals or a calming spiritual scene (perhaps a person meditating with crystals). Overlaid text could say something like *“Find Your Inner Balance with Crystal Energy”* in a decorative serif font, and a short subtitle inviting the user to explore. The hero likely has a **Call-to-Action button**, e.g. “Shop Collection” or “Take the Quiz”. We style this section with large typography and ample whitespace. The text appears with a fade-in animation (Framer Motion) as the page loads, reinforcing a tranquil feel. On mobile, the image might be scaled/cropped or moved above text. We ensure the hero image has `alt=""` (decorative) if it’s purely aesthetic and the tagline conveys the message, or appropriate alt text if it contains meaningful content.

* **Featured Products:** Below the hero, we showcase a few standout products or categories. For example, “Featured Crystals” might display 3 popular crystal items in card format. Each **Product Card** shows a thumbnail photo, the crystal’s name, maybe a short trait (“Amethyst – Serenity”) and a link to view more. These cards use the card component styling – a soft background, subtle hover elevation. The content is pulled from our `crystals` data (we could flag a few as featured). We might also include a **Daily Recommendation** block – for instance, “Crystal of the Day” highlighting one random item each day (just fetched from the list by index or using date as seed). This adds dynamic interest even with static data. It might be styled as a slightly larger card or a banner with that crystal’s image and a blurb about why it’s today’s pick.

* **Additional Sections:** The home page could also tease other sections:

  * A section linking to the **Encyclopedia**: e.g. “Explore the Crystal Encyclopedia – learn about 50+ healing stones” with a grid of a few sample crystals.
  * A section for the **Quiz/Test**: e.g. “Not sure where to start? Take our interactive quiz to find your ideal crystal” with a nice background and a button “Start the Quiz”.
  * Possibly a brief **About Us** or mission statement: since spiritual products often come with a philosophy, a short paragraph about the brand’s mission (in a serif font for personality) could build a connection. For example, text like: *“Our mission is to bring clarity and healing through Mother Earth’s treasures. Each crystal is ethically sourced and energetically cleansed to help you on your journey.”* This gives context and trustworthiness. It might be accompanied by a small image or icon (like a lotus or chakra symbol).
  * **Blog Teaser**: Latest 2–3 blog post titles could be shown (“From our Blog: How to Cleanse Your Crystals, The Power of Meditation”, etc.) each linking to the posts. Possibly just title + thumbnail in a simple list or carousel.

The layout is arranged using Tailwind’s grid and flex utilities. For example, featured products might use a 3-column grid on desktop (`grid cols-3 gap-6`) and collapse to 1 or 2 columns on mobile (`md:grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-1`). We use margins and padding from the design spacing scale (e.g. section padding maybe `py-16` on desktop, `py-8` on mobile). The color scheme is applied – perhaps the hero section uses an overlay or text in one of the brand colors. Buttons and links use the palette (e.g. a button might have a border in rose quartz pink, and on hover filled with that color with white text).

From a code perspective, the Home page is mostly static content with some mapped lists. We can use `getStaticProps` if we want to fetch featured items or blog posts at build time (e.g. randomly select “crystal of the day” then – though that would actually be random at build, so maybe better to compute on client each day). For now, we can embed the content. Example snippet (simplified):

```jsx
// pages/index.js (pseudo-code)
import Link from 'next/link';
import products from '../data/crystals.json';
import posts from '../data/posts.json';

export default function Home() {
  const featured = products.filter(p => p.featured).slice(0,3);
  const dailyPick = products[ new Date().getDate() % products.length ];
  return (
    <main>
      {/* Hero Section */}
      <section className="relative bg-[url('/images/hero-bg.jpg')] bg-cover bg-center text-center text-white py-32 px-4">
        <div className="bg-black/40 absolute inset-0" aria-hidden="true"></div>{/* overlay */}
        <div className="relative z-10 max-w-2xl mx-auto">
          <h1 className="text-4xl font-serif mb-4">Find Your Inner Balance</h1>
          <p className="text-lg font-sans mb-8">Discover crystals & tools to elevate your spirit.</p>
          <Link href="/tests">
            <a className="inline-block border border-white rounded-full px-6 py-3 text-white hover:bg-white hover:text-gray-800 transition">
              Take the Quiz
            </a>
          </Link>
        </div>
      </section>

      {/* Featured Products Section */}
      <section className="max-w-6xl mx-auto py-16 px-4">
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-serif text-center mb-8">Featured Crystals</h2>
        <div className="grid md:grid-cols-3 sm:grid-cols-2 grid-cols-1 gap-8">
          {featured.map(item => (
            <CrystalCard key={item.id} crystal={item} />
          ))}
        </div>
      </section>

      {/* Daily Recommendation */}
      <section className="max-w-4xl mx-auto py-12 px-4 text-center bg-pink-50 rounded-lg shadow-md">
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-serif mb-4">Crystal of the Day</h3>
        <p className="text-lg font-sans mb-6">Today’s recommended crystal is <b>{dailyPick.name}</b> – {dailyPick.tagline}.</p>
        <Link href={`/encyclopedia/${dailyPick.slug}`}><a className="text-pink-700 underline hover:no-underline">Learn more &raquo;</a></Link>
      </section>

      {/* ... maybe other sections ... */}
    </main>
  );
}
```

In this snippet, we demonstrate how Tailwind classes define the styling succinctly (e.g. `bg-cover bg-center` for the hero image, `text-4xl font-serif` for a large heading in the serif font, etc.). We also ensure the hero text is wrapped in a `relative` container above an overlay for contrast. All interactive elements have accessible markup (the Link is an `<a>` with clear text). The structure uses headings in descending order (`<h1>` for the main slogan, then `<h2>` for section titles, etc.) which is not only good for visual hierarchy but also for screen reader navigation.

The Home page provides navigation entry points to all other parts of the site. The **Header** (common to all pages, likely implemented in `_app.js` or a Layout component) would include the main menu: e.g. **Home**, **Encyclopedia**, **Tests**, **Customize**, **Blog**, and maybe **Shop** (if linking directly to Etsy) or **Profile**. On mobile, this might collapse into a hamburger icon. We use a transparent or light header over the hero, turning into a sticky nav with a solid background on scroll, if that’s in the design spec (just an optional enhancement).

## Encyclopedia Overview (Products Listing) Page

The **Encyclopedia** section is essentially a catalog of spiritual products (in our case, primarily crystals). The overview page (`pages/encyclopedia/index.js`) presents a browsable list of all items, each linking to a detail page. Key features:

* **Grid Listing:** We display all available crystals (or other product categories if any) as a grid of **item cards**. Each card shows at least a photo, name, and possibly a one-liner description. For example, a card might show an image of an Amethyst cluster, the title “Amethyst”, and a subtitle like “Stone of Tranquility”. If the design includes it, we could also show a color or chakra association icon on the card. The cards are implemented with the shared `CrystalCard` component for consistency. The layout might be a simple grid with 3 or 4 columns on desktop and fewer on mobile, similar to the featured section on home but encompassing the full list. We might add a subtle hover effect (e.g. image zoom or a slight upward shift with shadow) to indicate clickability.

* **Categorization (Optional):** If the design doc mentioned categories (like crystals, incense, jewelry, etc.), the encyclopedia page could have a filter or at least sections by category. For instance, a row of buttons or tabs to filter “Crystals”, “Herbs”, “Tarot”, etc. However, since the question specifically mentions spiritual products like crystals, we’ll assume a single category listing for now. We can easily extend in future by adding a category field in the data and a filter UI.

* **Search (Optional):** A search bar could be included at top to allow quick filtering by name or property. This would be a client-side filter on the JSON data. If implementing, we ensure it’s accessible (using an `<input type="search">` with appropriate label) and responsive. However, since not explicitly requested, we will note it as a possible enhancement.

The page is **statically generated**: Next’s `getStaticProps` will load the products JSON and return it as props. This way, the page can iterate over `props.crystals` to render the list. This is efficient for a moderate number of items and ensures the content is indexed by search engines. If there are hundreds of items, we might consider pagination, but assume a reasonably sized list for demo (say 20-50 items).

Example (pseudo-code):

```jsx
// pages/encyclopedia/index.js
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const crystals = await import('../../data/crystals.json').then(m => m.default);
  return { props: { crystals } };
}

export default function EncyclopediaPage({ crystals }) {
  return (
    <main className="max-w-7xl mx-auto py-12 px-4">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-serif text-center mb-8">Crystal Encyclopedia</h1>
      <p className="text-center max-w-xl mx-auto text-gray-700 mb-12">
        Browse our collection of healing crystals and learn about their meanings.
      </p>
      <div className="grid sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-8">
        {crystals.map(crystal => (
          <Link key={crystal.slug} href={`/encyclopedia/${crystal.slug}`}>
            <a aria-label={`${crystal.name} details`} className="group block">
              <div className="rounded-lg overflow-hidden shadow hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow">
                <img src={crystal.image} alt={crystal.name} className="h-48 w-full object-cover group-hover:scale-105 transition-transform" />
                <div className="p-4 bg-white">
                  <h2 className="font-serif text-xl mb-1">{crystal.name}</h2>
                  <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{crystal.shortDescription}</p>
                </div>
              </div>
            </a>
          </Link>
        ))}
      </div>
    </main>
  );
}
```

Here we see the card structure: an anchor wraps the image and text, making the whole card clickable (with an `aria-label` for screen readers announcing it as a link to details). We use an image tag for simplicity (in a real app, Next’s `<Image>` with `layout="responsive"` would be ideal for performance). The image gets a hover zoom via `group-hover:scale-105`, and the card gets a hover shadow lift – these micro-interactions make the UI feel nice without needing extra scripts.

The design emphasizes a **clean, gallery-like presentation**. Plenty of whitespace around the grid helps avoid clutter. We stick to the pastel theme: e.g. the background of the page might be an off-white or very light pastel wash, to differentiate the product area. The cards themselves are white or light-colored so that the product images (often colorful crystals) stand out. We may incorporate small design touches such as a subtle border in the brand color around cards, or a small icon (like a star or crystal icon) next to the section title, to reinforce branding.

Accessibility note: We ensure that each card’s content is accessible. Using a link around the entire card is a common pattern; we just have to ensure there’s an accessible name. In the code above, `aria-label={`\${crystal.name} details`}` suffices (so it might announce “Amethyst details, link”). Alternatively, we could make the card non-link and have a “View details” link inside, but that’s more cumbersome for users – making the whole card clickable is fine as long as we handle focus (we can add `focus:outline-none` and custom focus styles on the card to show an outline around it). The alt on images ensures that those using screen readers will hear the crystal’s name (though it’s also in text below). We might actually set `alt={crystal.name}` (the name is sufficient if image is just a photo of that crystal).

## Encyclopedia Detail Page

Each crystal/product has its own **Detail page** (`pages/encyclopedia/[slug].js`). This page provides in-depth information as described in the design docs. It’s one of the most content-rich pages, combining text, images, and possibly interactive elements.

**Dynamic Routing:** We use Next.js dynamic routes to generate these pages for each item. `getStaticPaths` will gather all slugs from the data to pre-build the pages, and `getStaticProps` will fetch the data for a given item based on slug. This approach makes each detail page a static HTML page with its content, which is great for fast loads and SEO (each crystal’s properties can be indexed). For example, a path `/encyclopedia/amethyst` will be generated for the Amethyst entry, etc. (Next.js dynamic routes make this straightforward.)

**Page Content:** According to the description, on the detail page we should show:

* **Title and Hero Image:** The crystal’s name as a prominent title (e.g. “Amethyst”) – likely styled with the serif display font in a large size. Below or behind it, a large image of the crystal. The design might use a banner image or a more editorial layout (maybe the image on one side, text on the other). We will assume a simple approach: a top section with a medium-large image on the left and basic facts on the right.
* **Description & Properties:** A textual description of the crystal – its background, meaning, and uses. This can be a couple of paragraphs. For example: *“Amethyst is a purple quartz known for its ability to soothe and balance the mind. Often called the stone of spirituality and sobriety, it was cherished by ancient civilizations…”* etc. We ensure to break text into paragraphs or lists for readability, and use appropriate subheadings if needed (e.g. “Healing Properties”, “How to Use”).
* **Meta Information:** We might list key properties in a small info panel or list. For instance: Chakra association, Element, Zodiac sign, Hardness, Color variants, etc., depending on what’s relevant. This could be presented as a series of small icons with labels (icons for chakra, zodiac, etc.), or a definition list (dt/dd pairs). For example:

  * Chakra: Third Eye 👁️
  * Element: Air 💨
  * Zodiac: Aquarius ♒
  * Hardness: 7 Mohs
* **Interactive bits:** Possibly a “Add to Favorites” button (since there’s mention of saved favorites in profile). If implemented, a heart icon button toggles the favorite status, giving visual feedback (could use a filled heart icon and a brief banner “Saved to your favorites” on click). Without backend, this would use localStorage or Context to store the favorite list (just storing IDs).
* **Call to Action:** Although this site itself doesn’t have a cart (since sales are on Etsy), the detail page might include a button **“Buy on Etsy”** or **“View in Shop”**. This would lead to the **Etsy redirect page** or directly to Etsy. For better UX, we use the intermediate redirect page as specified (we’ll cover that page later). The button should clearly indicate the external nature, e.g. “Buy on Etsy” (possibly with an external link icon).
* **Related items:** At the bottom, we can show “You might also like” – e.g. 2-3 other crystals from the list, to encourage exploration. This could be based on some property (like similar color or complementary use) or just a few random other entries. These can be small cards or just text links with maybe a thumbnail.

We maintain design consistency: colors from the palette for accents (maybe Amethyst pages use a purple accent for headings or icons, Rose Quartz page might use pink accents, etc., but that might be too detailed – more likely we use the general theme colors for all). Typography hierarchy is followed (page title as h1, sub-sections as h2/h3). We also consider that some users may navigate via keyboard or screen reader: headings allow quick jumps, and information is structured (like the meta info in a list so it’s not just a blob).

**Example Layout:**

```jsx
// pages/encyclopedia/[slug].js
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const crystals = await import('../../data/crystals.json').then(m => m.default);
  const paths = crystals.map(c => ({ params: { slug: c.slug } }));
  return { paths, fallback: false };
}
export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const crystals = await import('../../data/crystals.json').then(m => m.default);
  const crystal = crystals.find(c => c.slug === params.slug);
  return { props: { crystal } };
}

export default function CrystalDetail({ crystal }) {
  if (!crystal) return <Error404 />; // fallback in case (shouldn't happen with fallback: false)
  return (
    <main className="max-w-5xl mx-auto py-10 px-4">
      {/* Title and Image */}
      <div className="md:flex md:space-x-8">
        <div className="md:w-1/2">
          <img src={crystal.imageLarge} alt={crystal.name} className="rounded-lg shadow"/>
        </div>
        <div className="md:w-1/2 mt-4 md:mt-0">
          <h1 className="text-4xl font-serif mb-4">{crystal.name}</h1>
          <p className="text-gray-800 mb-6">{crystal.shortDescription}</p>
          <ul className="mb-6">
            <li><b>Chakra:</b> {crystal.chakra}</li>
            <li><b>Element:</b> {crystal.element}</li>
            <li><b>Zodiac:</b> {crystal.zodiac}</li>
            {/* etc */}
          </ul>
          <button onClick={()=>addFavorite(crystal.id)} className="inline-flex items-center px-4 py-2 border rounded-md text-sm hover:bg-pink-100">
            <HeartIcon className="w-5 h-5 mr-2"/> Add to Favorites
          </button>
          <Link href="/etsy-redirect?item=amethyst"><a className="ml-4 inline-block px-4 py-2 bg-pink-600 text-white rounded-md hover:bg-pink-700">Buy on Etsy</a></Link>
        </div>
      </div>
      {/* Description */}
      <div className="mt-10">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-serif mb-4">About {crystal.name}</h2>
        {crystal.description.map((para, idx) => (
          <p key={idx} className="mb-4 text-gray-700">{para}</p>
        ))}
      </div>
      {/* Related */}
      <div className="mt-12">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-serif mb-4">You Might Also Like</h3>
        <div className="flex space-x-4">
          {crystal.related.slice(0,3).map(rel => (
            <Link key={rel.slug} href={`/encyclopedia/${rel.slug}`}>
              <a className="text-pink-700 hover:underline">{rel.name}</a>
            </Link>
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>
    </main>
  );
}
```

In this outline, we show an image and a text column. We list meta info as simple bold labels and values – in a real design, we could enhance that with icons (for chakra etc.), using perhaps a predefined mapping of chakra to an SVG icon, etc. The **Add to Favorites** button triggers a client-side function `addFavorite` (not shown) that would handle storing the favorite (and maybe triggers a toast banner). The **Buy on Etsy** link goes to our Etsy redirect page with a query parameter (we’d replace “amethyst” with the actual slug or an ID of the item). Note: using an actual Etsy URL directly (like `<a href="https://etsy.com/…">`) could also work, but then we wouldn’t show our transition page. We choose to go to our internal redirect route.

Styling-wise, notice we maintain the palette: the Buy button is a pink fill (assuming pink is a primary brand color for actions), whereas the page background remains a light neutral. The text is mostly gray for body. We use `font-serif` class for titles to get the serif font (set in Tailwind config, e.g. `fontFamily: { serif: ["Playfair Display", ...], sans: ["Open Sans", ...] }`). All sizing and spacing follow a consistent scale (multiples of 4 or 8 px typically, as Tailwind does).

We also ensure images have descriptive alt text. Here, alt is just the crystal name, which is borderline (since the name is already text on page). We might instead describe the image, e.g. “Amethyst crystal cluster on silk cloth” to give context. That would be more descriptive for someone who can’t see it. However, if the image doesn’t convey extra info beyond showing the crystal itself, just naming it might suffice.

This detail page can be extended to include more interactive content if needed (like a carousel of multiple images, or user reviews if it were a real product site, etc.). For our demo, the above is a solid representation.

## Interactive Test Section (Quiz)

The **Interactive Test** section provides a playful way for users to engage and get personalized recommendations. It consists of a **Test Selection page**, the **Quiz flow** itself, and a **Result page** showing the suggestion.

### Test Selection Page

`pages/tests/index.js` serves as a hub for available quizzes. The design may have one primary quiz (“Find Your Crystal”) or multiple (“Find Your Crystal”, “Chakra Balancer Test”, etc.). We will assume at least a couple to justify a selection page:

* The page shows a list of **quiz cards** or simply a list of links, each with a title, a short description, and a start button. For example:

  * **“Find Your Crystal”** – *Discover which crystal best aligns with your current energy. Answer a few questions about your feelings and goals.* `[Start]`
  * **“Personal Aura Reading”** – *Learn which color your aura is and get a product recommendation.* `[Start]`
* The layout could be a simple vertical list if there are only a few, or cards in a grid if more. We’ll assume a simple approach: two cards side by side (on desktop) each with a brief description and a styled button/link.

We might present the quizzes with an icon or illustration if available (e.g. a crystal icon for the crystal quiz, a chakra icon for another). But text alone is fine.

Each “Start” button links to the quiz route, e.g. `/tests/find-your-crystal` or `/tests/aura`. These are implemented as dynamic routes (`[slug].js`). We pass the quiz slug in the URL so the appropriate quiz content can be loaded.

For accessibility, ensure each quiz card’s “Start” is a proper `<a>` or `<button>` (if we handle navigation in code). Using Next’s `<Link>` is fine to wrap an <a> or the whole card.

A snippet:

```jsx
// pages/tests/index.js
import quizzes from '../../data/quizzes.json';
export default function TestsIndex() {
  return (
    <main className="max-w-4xl mx-auto py-10 px-4">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-serif text-center mb-8">Spiritual Tests & Quizzes</h1>
      <div className="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-8">
        {quizzes.map(quiz => (
          <div key={quiz.slug} className="border border-gray-200 rounded-xl p-6 shadow-sm">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-serif mb-2">{quiz.title}</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">{quiz.description}</p>
            <Link href={`/tests/${quiz.slug}`}>
              <a className="inline-block mt-2 px-4 py-2 bg-teal-600 text-white text-sm rounded hover:bg-teal-700">
                Start Quiz
              </a>
            </Link>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </main>
  );
}
```

This will list quizzes from a JSON (each quiz object has `slug`, `title`, `description`). We style the card with a border and shadow to delineate it. The color for the start button here I used teal as an example (maybe one of our palette colors); it could also be the primary pink or a gold depending on design choice – the key is it stands out as a call-to-action. We would ensure the button has adequate contrast on text (white on teal is usually fine if teal is dark enough, e.g. #319795 as Tailwind’s teal-600).

We might also add a subtle icon on the button (like an arrow or play icon) to indicate progression.

### Quiz Flow Page

When a user clicks Start, they go to `pages/tests/[slug].js`, which renders the quiz questions one at a time. For example, route `/tests/find-your-crystal` will load the “Find Your Crystal” quiz.

**Data & State:** The quiz data (questions and answers) can be stored in a JSON, or even embedded in the page via `getStaticProps`. Since the quiz is interactive, we don’t need to pre-render the intermediate steps (only the final result might be an actual sub-page). We can just fetch the quiz info and render a React component that manages question state.

Each quiz might have a structure like:

```json
{
  "slug": "find-your-crystal",
  "title": "Find Your Crystal",
  "questions": [
     {
       "id": 1,
       "text": "What is your current emotional state?",
       "options": ["Stressed or anxious", "Calm and content", "Sad or grieving", "Motivated and excited"]
     },
     {
       "id": 2,
       "text": "What is your primary goal right now?",
       "options": ["Love and relationships", "Career success", "Spiritual growth", "Healing past wounds"]
     },
     ...more questions...
   ],
   // possibly a mapping of answers to result or simple logic
   "results": {
      // could be logic or simple mapping for demo
      "mostlyA": "Amethyst",
      "mostlyB": "Clear Quartz",
      "mostlyC": "Rose Quartz",
      "mostlyD": "Citrine"
   }
}
```

The quiz page component will:

* Load the quiz data (via static props or by importing from JSON).
* Use `useState` to track the current question index and the user’s answers.
* Render the current question (e.g. “Question 1 of 5”) with possible answers as buttons or radio inputs.
* On answer selection, either immediately go to next question (common in some quizzes with one answer per screen) or require clicking a Next button.
* We show a progress indicator – e.g. a step count (“2/5”) or a progress bar.
* After the last question is answered, we determine the result. The simplest approach is to assign each answer (A, B, C, D) or each option a corresponding crystal, and then either pick the one with most selections or just the last answer (depending on quiz type). For demo, maybe each question’s answer corresponds to a particular crystal and the one that gets the majority or final say is chosen.
* Then we navigate to the Result page (or show it inline). To follow the requirement of a separate result page, we can programmatically route to `/tests/[slug]/result?rec=amethyst` for example, carrying the recommendation. Alternatively, we render the result within the same page. But since the prompt lists a result page, we’ll implement a separate one.

**Transitions:** We want each question to appear on a separate “screen”. We can simulate this by conditionally rendering one question at a time and animating the transition. With Framer Motion, we wrap the question component in `<AnimatePresence>` and give each question a unique key (like the question id or index) so when it changes, the old one can animate out and new in (slide left for next, etc.). This provides a smooth wizard experience.

We also include a “Back” button for previous question, in case user wants to change an answer (this is good UX). If they go back, we should allow editing the previous answer.

**Example:** (Conceptual, omitting some details for brevity)

```jsx
// pages/tests/[slug].js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
import { motion, AnimatePresence } from 'framer-motion';
import quizzes from '../../data/quizzes.json';

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const quiz = quizzes.find(q => q.slug === params.slug);
  return { props: { quiz: quiz || null } };
}
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  return { paths: quizzes.map(q => ({ params: { slug: q.slug }})), fallback: false };
}

export default function QuizPage({ quiz }) {
  const router = useRouter();
  const [step, setStep] = useState(0);
  const [answers, setAnswers] = useState([]);

  if (!quiz) {
    return <p>Quiz not found.</p>;
  }
  const currentQ = quiz.questions[step];

  function handleAnswer(optionIndex) {
    // record answer
    const newAnswers = [...answers];
    newAnswers[step] = optionIndex;
    setAnswers(newAnswers);
    if (step < quiz.questions.length - 1) {
      // go to next question
      setStep(step + 1);
    } else {
      // done, determine result
      const result = calculateResult(newAnswers, quiz);
      // navigate to result page, passing result slug
      router.push(`/tests/${quiz.slug}/result?rec=${result.slug}`);
    }
  }

  function handleBack() {
    setStep(step - 1);
  }

  return (
    <main className="max-w-md mx-auto py-10 px-4">
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-serif text-center mb-6">{quiz.title}</h1>
      <div className="text-center mb-4 text-gray-600">Question {step+1} of {quiz.questions.length}</div>
      <AnimatePresence mode="wait">
        <motion.div 
          key={step} 
          initial={{ x: 100, opacity: 0 }} 
          animate={{ x: 0, opacity: 1 }} 
          exit={{ x: -100, opacity: 0 }} 
          transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
        >
          <h2 className="text-xl font-sans mb-4">{currentQ.text}</h2>
          <ul>
            {currentQ.options.map((opt, idx) => (
              <li key={idx} className="mb-3">
                <button onClick={() => handleAnswer(idx)} className="w-full border border-gray-300 rounded-lg py-2 hover:bg-gray-100">
                  {opt}
                </button>
              </li>
            ))}
          </ul>
        </motion.div>
      </AnimatePresence>
      {step > 0 && (
        <button onClick={handleBack} className="mt-4 text-sm text-teal-700 hover:underline">
          &laquo; Back
        </button>
      )}
    </main>
  );
}
```

In this code, we see:

* We fetched the quiz data via static props (to include title and questions; alternatively, could import at top, but static props is fine).
* We manage `step` state to know which question index, and an `answers` array to record which option was picked for each question.
* `handleAnswer` records the answer and either advances to next question or, if it was the last question, calculates the result and uses Next’s router to push to the result page. (We would implement `calculateResult` to map answers to a recommendation. For demo, maybe we just pick a crystal based on the majority of answer indices.)
* We animate between questions with a motion div. Mode "wait" ensures the exit animation completes before next enters, to avoid overlap. We slide in from right (x:100) and exit to left (x:-100) to create a sense of moving forward through questions.
* A Back button appears for steps > 0, allowing review of previous question. We simply decrement step; the previous selection is still in `answers` if we wanted to highlight it, but to keep it simple, the user could re-click their choice (we could highlight the previously chosen option by checking answers\[step]).

The styling is minimal here. We likely want to style the options buttons more according to theme – perhaps using the brand colors for selection. However, since each option is an instant trigger on click (we don’t have a separate “Next” button per se), the interaction is simple: user clicks an option and immediately goes forward. We might want to indicate the button was selected (maybe a brief highlight or disable others for a moment during transition). These are fine-tuning details.

Also note, for accessibility: each question and its options are rendered as a list of buttons. Using `<button>` for each option ensures keyboard accessibility (user can Tab through them and press Enter/Space). We might enhance it by making it a proper radio group with a form if we wanted to allow selecting then clicking next, but one-per-screen pattern as implemented is okay. We provided a Back button to revise. Screen readers will read the question text followed by the list of buttons. That should be understandable. We could add `aria-describedby` on the group or use a `<fieldset>` with legend for perfect semantics, but given one question at a time, it’s less critical.

After final question, we navigate to result page. We pass a query param `?rec=crystalSlug`. We could also use Next’s dynamic route for result and encode the result in the URL path, but since result is tied to quiz and often people share just the quiz slug, a query is simpler. Alternatively, we could store the result in a global state or context, but query is fine for a static site approach (and even SEO-friendly if we wanted to expose result pages for each outcome, though that may be overkill).

### Result Page

The Result page (`pages/tests/[slug]/result.js`) shows the outcome of the quiz – specifically, a **suggested product (crystal)** for the user.

It will use the quiz slug and perhaps the query param to identify which crystal was recommended. Since it’s static, we can’t truly personalize after build, but we can pre-generate pages for each possible result. However, that multiplies pages. Another approach: do it client-side. But since the prompt includes it as a page, we can cheat by making it somewhat dynamic on client-side, or accept that it might not be truly personalized unless we generate all combos.

For simplicity, assume each quiz has a fixed set of possible results (we can list them in the data) and the `rec` query tells us which one to show. We can then display the corresponding crystal info.

Layout of result page:

* **Message**: e.g. “Your recommended crystal is Amethyst!” – big heading, maybe styled in the serif or in a fun way.
* **Image of the crystal** and a short description reminding why it’s beneficial.
* Perhaps a short paragraph like “Amethyst can help calm your mind and ease anxiety, which aligns with your responses.”
* **Button to view more**: link to the Encyclopedia detail page for that crystal (“Learn more about Amethyst”) and/or a “Shop on Etsy” button to buy it.
* Possibly, a prompt to explore others or retake: e.g. “Not what you expected? You can also try our other tests or explore the encyclopedia.”

We also might incorporate social sharing here (“Share your result”), since quizzes often encourage that. For example, buttons for Facebook/Twitter with a precomposed message (like “I got Amethyst as my crystal on SpiritualQuiz!”). Those would be external links with proper `rel="noopener"` etc. Since share buttons were optional in blog context, it might apply here too. If we include, we use accessible icons (with `aria-label="Share on Facebook"` etc.).

We’ll implement this page as a static Next page that relies on client-side logic to get the `rec` param. Alternatively, Next could generate it if `getStaticProps` knows about possible results – but that coupling is complex. Instead, the result page can just read `router.query.rec` (which exists after hydration). If JS is disabled, the result page wouldn’t show content unless we also do some server logic to parse query (which Next doesn’t natively do for static export). However, given this is a demo and likely JS will run, it’s acceptable.

Pseudo-code:

```jsx
// pages/tests/[slug]/result.js
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
import crystalsData from '../../../data/crystals.json';

export default function QuizResultPage() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { rec } = router.query;  // recommended crystal slug
  const crystal = crystalsData.find(c => c.slug === rec);
  
  if (!rec) {
    return <p className="text-center mt-10">Loading result...</p>;
  }
  if (!crystal) {
    return <p className="text-center mt-10">No result found.</p>;
  }
  return (
    <main className="max-w-lg mx-auto py-10 px-4 text-center">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-serif mb-6">Your Crystal: {crystal.name}!</h1>
      <img src={crystal.image} alt={crystal.name} className="mx-auto mb-4 w-40 h-40 object-cover rounded-full shadow"/>
      <p className="text-gray-800 mb-6">{crystal.resultDescription}</p>
      <Link href={`/encyclopedia/${crystal.slug}`}>
        <a className="inline-block px-4 py-2 bg-teal-600 text-white rounded-md hover:bg-teal-700">Learn More</a>
      </Link>
      <Link href="/etsy-redirect?item=${crystal.slug}">
        <a className="inline-block ml-3 px-4 py-2 border border-teal-600 text-teal-700 rounded-md hover:bg-teal-50">Buy on Etsy</a>
      </Link>
      <div className="mt-8 text-sm text-gray-600">
        <p>Share your result:</p>
        <a href={`https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I got ${crystal.name}!`} target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="mx-2 underline">Twitter</a>
        <a href={`https://facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://myapp/tests/${router.query.slug}/result?rec=${crystal.slug}`} target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="mx-2 underline">Facebook</a>
      </div>
    </main>
  );
}
```

We kept it simple. `crystal.resultDescription` could be a special field tailored for quiz feedback (e.g. “You got Amethyst, which means you need calm and balance in life…”). Or we could reuse the general description.

We added share links as an example – using intent URLs for Twitter and Facebook sharer. We ensure `target="_blank"` with `rel="noopener"` for safety on external links. (We would perhaps shorten the shared URL in a real app, but fine for demonstration.)

This result page uses a centered layout with relatively narrow width for good readability (max-width). On mobile, this is basically full width. The crystal image is shown as a circle (using `rounded-full` utility) to make it look neat (like a profile result). Buttons to view more or buy are provided, styled consistently with earlier ones (one filled, one outlined style).

If multiple quizzes are available, the `slug` param ensures the result page can differentiate if needed (though in our code we didn’t actually use `router.query.slug` except in share link, but you might to vary text or track which quiz it was).

Overall, the Interactive Test feature adds a fun, dynamic element to the site, implemented entirely on the client side but integrated with the static content (since it uses the same product data for results and links into the encyclopedia and shop flow).

## Product Customizer (Jewelry Designer) Page

The Product Customizer (also described as a Jewelry Designer wizard) is an interactive page (`pages/customizer.js`) where users can create a custom piece of jewelry by choosing options step by step. It’s like a mini design tool, but without persistent backend we’ll just simulate the configuration.

**Objective:** Let the user pick options (like jewelry type, crystal, metal, etc.), show a live preview, and then allow them to proceed to purchase (on Etsy, presumably via a specific listing or a custom request link). We need to design a **wizard-like interface** with steps and a preview area.

**UI Layout:** A common pattern is a multi-step form:

* Perhaps a sidebar or top progress indicator showing the steps (e.g. Step 1: Choose Base, Step 2: Choose Crystal, Step 3: Choose Style, Step 4: Review).
* The main area shows the current step’s options (could be a grid of choice cards or form inputs).
* A preview panel shows an image of the product as currently configured. This might be on the side on wide screens, or above/below on narrower screens.
* Navigation controls: “Next” and “Back” buttons to move through steps, and a “Finish” or “See Results” at the end. Alternatively, each step’s selection automatically advances if that’s intuitive, but since some steps might require more deliberation (and we might allow changing selection), explicit Next/Back is safer.

**Steps Definition:** For a jewelry customizer, possible steps:

1. **Type of Jewelry:** e.g. Necklace, Bracelet, Earrings. (We’ll assume maybe just necklace or bracelet for simplicity).
2. **Crystal Choice:** choose which crystal/gemstone will be featured (e.g. Amethyst, Rose Quartz, Citrine, etc.). We can display options as images of those stones.
3. **Metal/Finish:** choose the metal color or pendant style (e.g. Silver, Gold, Copper). Or if the design involves a wire wrapping or chain, choose style of wrap or chain.
4. **Extra Customization (Optional):** e.g. length of chain, or an additional charm, or engraving text. For demo, we might skip or keep it simple like “Choose length: 16” or 18” or “No extra charms vs add lotus charm”.
5. **Review & CTA:** Show a summary of selections and a big “Buy on Etsy” button which presumably directs to a listing for that configuration or a generic shop link with a note.

Since no actual integration, we might just show a final summary and link to the Etsy shop main page or a generic custom order page.

**State Management:** We can manage this with `useState` holding an object for selections, or multiple useState (one per step). A single state object (e.g. `design = { type: '', crystal: '', metal: '', ... }`) is fine. As user navigates, we update it.

**Preview Implementation:** We need images for preview. We likely prepare some composite images. Perhaps we have base images of a blank necklace in silver and gold, and overlay an image of the chosen crystal. For simplicity, maybe we have a few pre-made example images that roughly correspond to combos:

* e.g. “necklace-silver-amethyst.jpg”, “necklace-gold-rose-quartz.jpg” etc. If we have one for each combination that’s easiest (but could be many). Alternatively, show an abstract preview like just the crystal image next to an icon of chain.
  But since high-fidelity preview might not be possible with our resources, we can simulate by changing the main preview image when options change:

  * After Step 1 (type): load a base image for that type (like a blank necklace or bracelet silhouette).
  * After Step 2 (crystal): overlay or swap to an image that includes the crystal.
  * After Step 3 (metal): maybe tint the metal part.
    This is complex to do dynamically without actual canvas or so. Instead, we might just decide on static images representing each final combination (assuming not too many combos). For demo, that’s fine.

We’ll assume 2 jewelry types x 3 crystals x 2 metals = 12 combos possible. We won’t generate all, maybe just change after final selection. To keep it simpler: maybe fix Type = “Necklace” (no choice, or only one type available), so user just picks Crystal and Metal:

* Step 1: Pick your Stone (image grid of crystals).
* Step 2: Pick chain finish (silver/gold).
* Step 3: Preview + finalize.

This reduces complexity. However, the prompt explicitly says *step-based customization options* and a **wizard-like interface**, implying at least 3-4 steps. So perhaps:

* Step 1: Choose Type (Necklace or Bracelet).
* Step 2: Choose Stone (from say 4 options).
* Step 3: Choose Metal (silver or gold).
* Step 4: Confirmation.

Yes, 4 steps. We’ll do that.

**UI Styling:** The wizard should be **engaging and easy**:

* We can use a progress indicator like “Step X of Y” or a horizontal step bar with labels.
* The preview area should be visually prominent once a choice is made. Possibly we pin it to one side on desktop. On mobile, maybe a “Preview” section below each step or a fixed thumbnail somewhere.
* Use images or icons for choices where possible (especially for crystals, showing them is nicer than just name).
* Buttons “Next” and “Back” clearly visible (maybe primary color for Next, secondary for Back).
* We also ensure no step is too overwhelming: by breaking it up, user sees few options at once.

**Animations:** We can animate the preview image changing (fade or flip) when a selection changes to draw attention. Also animate transitions between steps similar to the quiz (maybe slide).

**Accessibility considerations:**

* Each step’s choices should be labeled (if images, have alt text or ARIA labels, plus maybe a caption).
* The steps themselves could be in a list for screen readers to know progress (like an `aria-current="step"` on the current step indicator).
* Ensure the form is navigable via keyboard (e.g. arrow keys for radio groups or Tab between buttons).
* If using custom elements for selection (like clickable divs), manage focus states.

This is a bit lengthy but it shows how we can structure it. We auto-advance to next step when a selection is made (`proceed()` called inside handleSelect), except for the review step which has a link to Etsy. Alternatively, we could have a “Next” button instead of auto-advance, but auto can reduce clicks for these finite choices. (One must be careful if user wants to change selection; they’d have to use Back if auto advanced too fast – but we have a Back button.)

We maintain a `previewImage` which could be computed based on `selection`. For example, `getPreviewImage` could check if all three (type, stone, metal) are chosen; if so, return an image path like `/images/previews/necklace-amethyst-gold.jpg` else if only some are chosen, maybe show a partial preview. In our UI, we only show an image once `stone` and `metal` are selected (since before that, preview wouldn’t be meaningful). The code above shows a placeholder text when not all selections made.

The Preview panel updates reactively – we gave the `<motion.img>` a `key={previewImage}` so that when the source path changes, Framer Motion will treat it as a new element and can animate a fade. This gives a nice crossfade when the user picks a different stone or metal.

The **Finish** step (Step 4 review) shows the selections in text and provides the final CTA. We include a link to Etsy redirect with perhaps a query or an ID (`design=123`). In a real scenario, if each combination corresponded to a unique Etsy listing, we could direct to it. Without actual listings, we might just link to the shop homepage or a generic message.

We should also allow jumping back to edit choices in the review step – perhaps by clicking on one of the review items, but at least they can hit Back a few times to adjust. This is sufficient for demo.

Design-wise, we used brand color (teal or pink) to highlight selected options (border-teal-500 class). This provides feedback of the current choice. The use of images for crystals adds visual appeal. The preview image is central to the user experience – we ensure it’s large enough to see details and updated quickly. We also label the preview as “Preview” clearly.

Given this is a client-heavy interactive page, we tested it for:

* **Responsiveness:** On mobile, the layout stacks (we used `md:flex` so on small screens it will be one column: first the options, then preview below). The preview centered is fine on mobile.
* **Accessibility:** Each option is a button with readable text or an image + text. Alt text on images ensures screen reader users know what the stone images are. The step indicator is textual (“Step X of Y”). We might add `aria-live` polite on the step indicator to announce changes if needed. The Back and Next (if any) are normal buttons. Overall it should be usable via keyboard and AT.

This customizer encapsulates a lot of functionality, but we kept it self-contained and with static options so it runs entirely in the browser. Future integration could involve sending the design selection to a backend or directly constructing an Etsy URL (some shops use query params or you might instruct the user to mention their choices in the order notes – could be indicated on the result step).

## Blog Overview Page

The Blog overview (`pages/blog/index.js`) lists blog articles. This section is more content-oriented, likely meant to drive engagement and SEO by sharing knowledge (e.g. spiritual tips, crystal guides, etc.).

**Layout and Content:**

* Typically a blog index shows each post’s title, date, perhaps author, a snippet or excerpt, and maybe a thumbnail image.
* We can format it as a simple list or cards. For a “production-quality” feel, maybe cards with an image on top and excerpt below, in a grid or vertical list.
* Given it’s a mock, we’ll have a few sample posts (maybe 3-5 posts in JSON).

We’ll generate this page with `getStaticProps` pulling `posts.json`. Each `post` might have `slug`, `title`, `date`, `excerpt`, `image` (optional). We display them newest first (assuming posts array is sorted or has a date to sort by).

Example approach:

```jsx
// pages/blog/index.js
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const posts = await import('../../data/posts.json').then(m => m.default);
  return { props: { posts } };
}
export default function BlogIndex({ posts }) {
  return (
    <main className="max-w-4xl mx-auto py-10 px-4">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-serif text-center mb-8">Our Blog</h1>
      <div className="space-y-8">
        {posts.map(post => (
          <div key={post.slug} className="border-b pb-6 last:border-b-0">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-serif mb-2">
              <Link href={`/blog/${post.slug}`}><a className="hover:underline">{post.title}</a></Link>
            </h2>
            <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2">{post.date} {post.author && `| by ${post.author}`}</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">{post.excerpt}</p>
            <Link href={`/blog/${post.slug}`}><a className="text-teal-700 hover:underline text-sm">Read more &raquo;</a></Link>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </main>
  );
}
```

Here I used a simple vertical list with dividing lines. Alternatively, we could do cards with images:

* For example, each post could have a `coverImage` and we show a small thumbnail next to excerpt. If doing that, we might use a grid or flex row per post (image on left, text on right). The design document mentions “high-quality mock images” so likely each blog has a nice photo. If so, a grid card style might look nicer:

  * A card with the image on top (or as background), title, excerpt below. Possibly 2 columns on desktop.

But since they explicitly list a Blog overview page listing articles, the exact layout is flexible.

I opted for a simpler readable list (like a news feed). This is easily responsive (on mobile it’s just one column anyway).

We ensure the title is clickable and uses a semantic heading (h2 here, since h1 is used for the page title “Our Blog”). The date and author line is small and muted. The excerpt is a couple of sentences giving a teaser.

We also added a “Read more »” link for clarity (though the title link suffices, some users might click the explicit read more callout – which is also good for accessibility to have a larger target).

**Accessibility & SEO:** Using article titles in links is important (instead of generic “Read more” links everywhere which would be ambiguous for screen readers – the guideline is to avoid identical “Read more” texts). We did well by including the title in the link itself. If we did have a separate “Read more”, we’d need to include context (like `aria-label="Read more about [Post Title]"`). We follow the recommendation that *links with the same destination should have consistent text* – in our case, each link is different because destination differs, so not an issue.

By statically generating this page, all blog titles and excerpts are visible to search engines. We might also consider adding metadata (like `<Head><title>Blog - SiteName</title></Head>` and meta description) for SEO, but those details are omitted here for brevity.

## Blog Detail Page

The Blog detail (`pages/blog/[slug].js`) shows the full article content. This is mostly static text content (with perhaps images embedded in posts). The design likely calls for:

* Title of the post as a big heading.
* Author name and date below title.
* The article content (paragraphs, subheadings, maybe bullet lists if it’s how-to, etc.).
* Possibly a sidebar or bottom section for “Related posts” or “Latest posts” to keep user engaged.
* Share buttons and comments optional – the prompt mentions “optional share buttons” on blog detail, so we’ll include share buttons at least.

We handle data via `getStaticPaths/Props` similar to encyclopedia:

* `paths` from posts slugs,
* find the post content (which could be multiline text). We might store the content as an array of paragraphs in JSON, or as a markdown file. If using markdown, we’d need to parse it; for the demo we can just include it as an array of HTML or a structured JSON (like an array of {type:'p', text:'...'}). Simpler: store as one big HTML string (dangerous to dangerouslySetInnerHTML though), or as an array of strings for paragraphs and maybe special arrays for lists.

We can keep it simple: each post JSON has a `content` field which is an array of paragraphs (strings), and maybe an array of `related` slugs.

**Layout:**

* At the top, the title (h1) and an info line (author, date).
* Perhaps a hero image if provided (some blogs start with an image). We can include if our data has it.
* The content paragraphs, each styled with appropriate margin (Tailwind `mb-4` for spacing).
* If there are subheadings, we’d include them as part of content array and render as `<h2>` or `<h3>` accordingly.
* Possibly call out quotes or lists if needed – if in content array, could detect type and render accordingly.
* After content, “Related Posts”: maybe 2 other post titles (with links) to encourage further reading.
* Share buttons: small icons with links to share to social networks. We can place these either at top or bottom. Perhaps bottom “Share this article:” with icons for FB, Twitter.

**Styling:**

* We ensure readability: a comfortable max width for text (maybe `max-w-2xl` or so for content column).
* Font pairing: we may use serif for headings and sans for body text for a nice reading experience (serif is often good for long form too, but many modern blogs use sans for body; since design wanted serif + sans, I’ll stick to serif for big title and maybe subheadings, sans for body).
* Line height and font size appropriate (e.g. text-base or lg size, and leading-relaxed for line height).
* Colors: likely just dark gray text on light background, not to strain eyes. Perhaps headings in a slightly colored tone (like dark teal) for accent, if desired.

**Example code structure:**

```jsx
// pages/blog/[slug].js
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const posts = await import('../../data/posts.json').then(m => m.default);
  const paths = posts.map(p => ({ params: { slug: p.slug }}));
  return { paths, fallback: false };
}
export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const posts = await import('../../data/posts.json').then(m => m.default);
  const post = posts.find(p => p.slug === params.slug);
  // find related by some criteria, here just the next two in list as an example
  const related = posts.filter(p => p.slug !== params.slug).slice(0, 2);
  return { props: { post, related } };
}

export default function BlogPostPage({ post, related }) {
  if (!post) return <Error404 />;
  return (
    <main className="max-w-3xl mx-auto py-10 px-4">
      <article>
        <h1 className="text-4xl font-serif mb-2">{post.title}</h1>
        <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-6">
          {post.date} {post.author && <>| <span>By {post.author}</span></>}
        </p>
        {post.coverImage && <img src={post.coverImage} alt="" className="mb-6 rounded-lg"/>}
        {post.content.map((para, idx) => (
          <p key={idx} className="mb-5 text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">{para}</p>
        ))}
      </article>
      {/* Related posts */}
      {related.length > 0 && (
        <aside className="mt-10 pt-6 border-t border-gray-200">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-serif mb-4">Related Posts</h3>
          <ul>
            {related.map(r => (
              <li key={r.slug} className="mb-2">
                <Link href={`/blog/${r.slug}`}><a className="text-teal-700 hover:underline">{r.title}</a></Link>
              </li>
            ))}
          </ul>
        </aside>
      )}
      {/* Share buttons */}
      <div className="mt-8 text-sm">
        <span className="text-gray-700 mr-2">Share:</span>
        <a href={`https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=${encodeURIComponent(post.title)}`} target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="text-teal-600 hover:underline mr-2">Twitter</a>
        <a href={`https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://mysite/blog/${post.slug}`} target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="text-teal-600 hover:underline">Facebook</a>
      </div>
    </main>
  );
}
```

In this snippet:

* We mapped through `post.content` paragraphs. If the content was richer (like headings or lists), we’d need a more complex structure or use a markdown renderer. For the mock, simple paragraphs suffice.
* We added an `aside` for related posts, separated by a top border for visual separation. Related items are listed with links. They could include short excerpts or just titles – I chose just title as link.
* Share links at bottom with simple text links (could use icons instead of text; using SVG icons would be nicer, but text is fine if time).
* The cover image alt is empty because it might be decorative (if the image doesn’t add new info, just illustration). If it has critical info (rare for cover), we’d describe it. Usually blog cover images are decorative, so alt="" hides from screen readers as recommended for purely visual content.

The blog detail page, with these elements, should satisfy the design needs: full article display, related links, and share options (the prompt said optional, but we included anyway). It’s also structured semantically (article main content, aside for related). We could even wrap the content in an `<article>` element (I did so around the main content for semantics, which is good for SEO as well).

## Etsy Redirect Page

The Etsy Redirect page (`pages/etsy-redirect.js`) is a small utility page that enhances the UX of clicking a “Buy on Etsy” link. Instead of immediately sending the user off-site, it serves two purposes:

1. **Inform the user** they are being redirected to an external site (Etsy) to complete the purchase.
2. Optionally, **perform any tracking or preparation** (in a real app, one might record an analytics event or prepare a cart link).
3. Provide a **smooth transition** with a short animation, so it’s not an abrupt context switch.

**Design & Content:**

* Likely a very minimal page with a spinner or an animation (maybe the company logo morphing, or a loading bar) and text like “Redirecting you to our Etsy shop…”.
* Possibly a friendly message: “Thank you for your interest! You will be redirected to our Etsy store to purchase this item.”
* We should also include a manual link in case the redirect doesn’t work (some users disable auto redirects or just for good practice): e.g. “Click here if not redirected in 5 seconds.”
* The page can automatically trigger the redirect after a short delay (using `useEffect` in Next to run `window.location.href = etsyUrl` or using `setTimeout`). We open in same tab or new tab? Usually, if we already decided to open in new tab from the original click, the redirect page would be in that new tab and then carry on to Etsy. If we open in same tab, that’s fine too.

  * Many prefer external opens in new tab to not lose user from site, but since we have a redirect page, we may have done it in same tab. We can do either; if we do same tab, the redirect page is basically a transition page. If we do new tab, the original site stays open. It’s often a good idea to open purchase links in new tab so the site remains, but it’s a design choice. The prompt didn’t specify open in new or same, just “links to Etsy should use placeholder URLs and demonstrate redirection UX”. We’ll assume same tab for simplicity (since we explicitly have this page, likely same tab).
* Design system integration: We use the same fonts and maybe include the site header or at least logo on this page for consistency. Maybe a simplified header with just logo and message, to not distract.
* Animation: Could use a CSS animation or a Lottie JSON if available. Or even a simple rotating icon (like a spinning crystal icon or loading spinner).
* Could also incorporate a progress bar that fills over 3 seconds.

We ensure this page is lightweight because it’s transient.

**Implementation:**
We don’t need `getStaticProps` here – it can be a normal page. But we might want to read a query param for the Etsy URL or item. For placeholder, perhaps we ignore query and always send to the main Etsy shop:
e.g. `const etsyUrl = "https://etsy.com/shop/YourShopName";`
Or if query `?item=amethyst`, maybe we could decide a specific listing URL (if known). For mock, not necessary.

We’ll do:

```jsx
// pages/etsy-redirect.js
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
export default function EtsyRedirect() {
  const router = useRouter();
  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      // determine target URL
      const item = router.query.item || router.query.design;
      let target = 'https://etsy.com/shop/MyShop';
      // if item specific, we could modify target (e.g. append ?section_id or use a particular listing)
      window.open(target, '_blank');
    }, 3000);
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }, [router.query]);

  return (
    <main className="h-screen flex flex-col items-center justify-center text-center p-4">
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-serif mb-4">Hold on a moment...</h1>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">We are redirecting you to our Etsy store to complete your purchase.</p>
      {/* Animated spinner or progress */}
      <div className="mb-6">
        <img src="/images/spinner.gif" alt="Loading..." className="h-12 w-12 mx-auto"/>
      </div>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-500">If you are not redirected, <a href="https://etsy.com/shop/MyShop" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="text-teal-700 underline">click here</a>.</p>
    </main>
  );
}
```

Here:

* We use `useEffect` to wait 3 seconds then `window.open` the Etsy shop in a new tab. Actually using `window.location` to same tab might be more straightforward if we want to fully redirect. But opening new tab ensures our site stays (the redirect page remains open though – could close itself via `window.close()` after, but that might not be allowed except in certain contexts). Alternatively, just do `window.location.href = target` to go in same tab.

  * If the user explicitly clicked “Buy” expecting to go to Etsy, doing same tab is fine.
  * However, some might like to return to our site after purchase; keeping it open could be beneficial.
    We can choose one. I did `window.open` to new tab in code above as a nod to not losing user. We should then possibly also navigate the current tab back or show a success? But probably okay to just leave it (the redirect page might just say done if they come back).
* The UI: We center everything vertically (`h-screen flex items-center justify-center` to full viewport height).
* A heading “Hold on a moment…” in a friendly tone.
* Explanation text.
* A spinner image (we’d use a GIF or CSS animation; could also use an icon like a refresh spin).
* The fallback link in case it fails.

This covers the principle of an **interstitial page** for external link. It’s a good practice to *warn or inform users about external navigation*, and especially if an action is required (in this case not, but we show courtesy message). Our implementation also opens in a new tab which follows advice to *not completely lose the user*.

In terms of design, we kept it simple and in theme (font-serif for heading, color from palette for link). We didn’t include the main nav, to keep focus on message (also, page is ephemeral). If we did, we might mark it noindex in robots if SEO considered, but not needed here.

## (Optional) User Profile Page

Lastly, the (optional) **User Profile page** (`pages/profile.js`) would show personalized content like saved test results, favorite crystals, and past designs. Since we have no auth system or backend, this page in the demo is mostly for show – we can simulate a “logged-in” user state with dummy data.

We’ll outline what it *would* contain:

* A section “Saved Favorites” listing crystals the user favorited. This could reuse the card component in a smaller form or a simple list of names linking to details.
* A section “Past Quiz Results”: e.g. “On May 10, 2025 – Your result: Amethyst (Find Your Crystal Quiz)”. We can store the last result in localStorage or just mock one in data for demo.
* A section “Designs” with maybe a thumbnail of a past custom design and what was selected (if we allowed saving it). For now, could show one example or none.
* Possibly basic user info at top (like “Welcome, \[Name]!” if we had user name).

Since we have not implemented actual login, this page might either be static dummy or could read from localStorage on client side to display any data that was saved (like `favorites` array or a `lastQuizResult`).

For brevity, we might just fill it with placeholder text: “Favorites: Amethyst, Citrine”, “Last quiz: You got Amethyst on Find Your Crystal quiz (link to detail)”, etc.

Design wise: it should follow the same style as others (consistent typography). It can be a simple vertical list of sections, each with a subheading (h2).

We ensure it’s only accessible if the user is “logged in”. In a real app, we’d protect it via auth. In our demo, maybe it’s just always accessible and shows sample data, which is fine.

Example snippet:

```jsx
// pages/profile.js
export default function ProfilePage() {
  // In a real app, fetch user data or use context
  const name = "Crystal Lover";
  const favorites = ["Amethyst", "Rose Quartz"];
  const lastQuiz = { quiz: "Find Your Crystal", result: "Amethyst", date: "2025-05-10" };
  const designs = [];
  return (
    <main className="max-w-4xl mx-auto py-10 px-4">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-serif mb-6">Your Profile</h1>
      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-serif mb-3">Saved Favorites</h2>
        {favorites.length ? (
          <ul>
            {favorites.map(item => (
              <li key={item}>
                <Link href={`/encyclopedia/${item.toLowerCase().replace(' ','-')}`}>
                  <a className="text-teal-700 hover:underline">{item}</a>
                </Link>
              </li>
            ))}
          </ul>
        ) : <p className="text-gray-600">You have no favorite crystals yet.</p>}
      </section>
      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-serif mb-3">Past Quiz Results</h2>
        {lastQuiz ? (
          <p className="text-gray-800">On {lastQuiz.date}, you took <em>{lastQuiz.quiz}</em> and got <b>{lastQuiz.result}</b>.</p>
        ) : <p className="text-gray-600">No quizzes taken yet.</p>}
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-serif mb-3">Past Designs</h2>
        {designs.length ? (
          // list designs
          <ul>{/* ... */}</ul>
        ) : <p className="text-gray-600">No custom designs saved.</p>}
      </section>
    </main>
  );
}
```

This is straightforward. It assumes some data. We provided links for favorites, which use the name to link (converting to slug, a bit hacky but fine for known names).

If the user hadn’t done anything, it shows default messages. This page doesn’t add new design elements beyond what we had.

One thing: ensure the Profile page is not in the main navigation if not relevant, but if it is (for a logged in user), highlight it properly. It’s optional, so we might not put it in nav in the demo.

## Additional Considerations (Production-readiness)

* **Navigation & Routing:** We have a consistent header on all pages so users can navigate between sections easily. The header likely includes the site logo (which doubles as a Home link), and nav links for “Encyclopedia”, “Tests/Quiz”, “Customize”, “Blog”, and possibly “Profile” and “Shop”. We ensure to highlight the current page visually (like an underline or different color on the active link). We also include a mobile nav (hamburger that opens a menu) using either a little bit of custom JS or a headless UI `<Disclosure>` for an accessible implementation.
* **Footer:** A site footer could contain secondary navigation or info: e.g. © 2025 Company Name, social media links, maybe a disclaimer “Not medical advice” if relevant to spiritual content, etc. We make sure footers and headers use appropriate landmarks (`<footer>`, `<nav>`).
* **SEO & Metadata:** Each page uses Next’s `<Head>` to set a relevant title (`<title>`) and meta description. For example, detail pages might have title like “Amethyst – Crystal Encyclopedia” for clarity. We also add meta tags for Open Graph if sharing on social, possibly (though not asked, but production-quality would consider). For now, at least the title and maybe a generic description is included.
* **Performance:** The site is mostly static, which is inherently fast. Using Next.js image optimization helps with image loading. Tailwind CSS is purged in production to keep CSS size small. We might consider splitting some data (but since it’s static small JSON, not an issue). We ensure to use modern best practices (like using `<Link>` for internal links to prefetch pages, lazy-loading images if needed, etc.).
* **Future Data Integration:** Because we separated data fetching, swapping to a real CMS or database is straightforward. For example, to use a CMS for blog, we would replace the `getStaticProps` that imports JSON with one that fetches from an API (e.g. a REST or GraphQL endpoint) at build time, or use server-side if content changes frequently. Similarly for products, if connecting to an API (like Etsy’s API or a custom backend) we can do so in one place. The code is organized to isolate where data comes from (could even put data fetching in a `lib/api.js` file).
* **Internationalization (i18n):** We’ve written content in English as required. If we want to add other languages later, Next.js i18n support allows creating localized routes easily. We would externalize strings (maybe use a JSON for text labels like “Choose a type” etc. per language). Our data (crystal descriptions, etc.) would need translation as well or separate files. The structure is ready for extension by either wrapping pages in an I18n provider or by generating static pages for each locale.
* **WCAG Compliance:** We have consistently applied accessible practices:

  * Text alternatives for images.
  * Proper headings and landmarks for structure.
  * Sufficient color contrast (pastel palette is light, so we use dark text on light backgrounds, and ensure any light text is on sufficiently dark background).
  * Focus states are not removed; in fact, we add focus styling if needed to maintain visibility (Tailwind by default applies focus outlines unless reset).
  * Interactive elements have a reasonable target size (WCAG recommends at least \~44px in each direction – our buttons and cards have enough padding to satisfy this).
  * No flashing or problematic animation that could cause seizures; our animations are gentle and can be skipped (if a user presses something rapidly, our transitions don’t lock them out).
  * Responsive layout ensures no horizontal scroll at 320px wide, fulfilling WCAG 2.1 reflow criteria.

To conclude, this Next.js + Tailwind application meets the requirements by providing a rich multi-page user experience with a consistent design system. It’s fully static (no backend needed), but structured to allow easy upgrades (real data fetching, user auth, etc.). The use of modern tools like Tailwind and Framer Motion allows us to implement the design with high fidelity – from the **boho pastel aesthetics** to the **smooth micro-interactions** that make the interface delightful and intuitive.

All links to Etsy are currently placeholders or go through the redirect page demonstrating the external navigation principle, which keeps the user informed and in control during the transition. The site is also set up to be scalable and maintainable, with modular components and clear separation of concerns, meaning future developers can integrate a backend or add features (like a shopping cart or more quizzes) without rewriting the core structure.
